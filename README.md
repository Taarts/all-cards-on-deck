# all_cards_on_deck

Objectives

Demonstrate usage of List or arrays to model resources.
Understand and implement algorithms.
Understand loops.
Requirements

Your deck should contain 52 unique cards.
All cards should be represented as a string such as "Ace of Hearts"
There are four suits: "Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", and "Spades".
There are 13 ranks: "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", and "King".
You will model these in code, in any way you see fit. It may require you to experiment and try several techniques. There are many valid solutions.

Explorer Mode

Once the program starts, you should create a new deck.
After deck creation, you should shuffle the deck.
After the deck is shuffled, display the top two cards.

Adventure Mode

In addition to displaying the top two cards, also store these two "dealt" cards in a variable named playerHand. Consider what type of variable playerHand will have to be.
Implement a way to two deal cards each into two different hands.
